A project that makes an urgent notification system. 

It is a simplified version of the current project I've worked on.
It allows users to input a type of emergency that occured and immediately notify responsible employees by sending out a message.
All of the accidents are stored and have statuses as well as comments that can be set by employees to keep track of the accident history.

also I have this app self-hosted with Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer https://sos.metabroadcast.ru

**use ```codeuser``` login to try out the app**

Key features:
- Adaptive for mobile
- Uses MUI library
- Json-server used as a jwt auth service
- Extended Ky handles access tokens
- The app is i18ned
- Cards are virtualized to improve performance
