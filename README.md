A project that makes an urgent notification system. It is a simplified version of the current project I work on.
It allows users to input a type of emergency that occured and immediately notify responsible employees by sending out a message.
All of the accidents are stored and have statuses as well as comments that can be set by employees to keep track of the accident history.
